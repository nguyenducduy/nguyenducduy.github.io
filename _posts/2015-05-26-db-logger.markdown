In this framework, i used extra Phalcon Logger Incubator library for store log information in database.
More at [Phalcon Incubator Library](https://github.com/phalcon/incubator).

You need simply call to store log information, example i used in ***CodegeneratorController.php*** file when user generate CRUD structure or ***LoginController.php*** when user login to admin area.

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
$this->logger->name = 'LOGIN';
$this->logger->info('Information u want to store');
{% endhighlight %}

Go to http://yoursite/admin/logs to view log

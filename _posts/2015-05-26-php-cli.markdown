CLI applications are executed from the command line. They are useful to create cron jobs, scripts, command utilities and more.

### Structure
A minimal structure of a CLI application will look like this:

* cli/app/tasks/MainTask.php
* cli/cli.php <â€“ main bootstrap file

This console app used same config file of web app located at ***/conf/global.php***

### Tasks
Tasks work similar to controllers. Any CLI application needs at least a mainTask and a mainAction and every task needs to have a mainAction which will run if no action is given explicitly.

For example calling a task in console app, you need declare like below:

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
<?php

use Phalcon\CLI\Task as PhTask;

class MainTask extends PhTask
{
    public function mainAction()
    {

    }

    public function testAction()
    {
        echo CURRENT_TASK . PHP_EOL;
        echo CURRENT_ACTION . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then call in Terminal:

```
php cli/cli.php main test
```

That will print to terminal 2 string

```
main
test
```
